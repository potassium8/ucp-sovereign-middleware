> **WARNING**
> This middleware enforces strict adherence to **Article 27 of Law n° 2024-449** (SREN). Any cloud provider configuration detecting egress fees > 0.00€ will result in a hard blocking of UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) agent transactions.

## 🏗 Context

As **Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** becomes the standard for Agentic Commerce, organizations risk losing control over their data "signal" and incurring massive hidden costs through unmonitored egress.

This repository implements a **Sovereign Interception Layer**. It ensures that your catalogue data is only exposed to Agents (Google, OpenAI) if:
1. The infrastructure guarantees **Zero-Egress Fees** (as per Arrêté du 17/11/2025).
2. The Agent's intent provides a positive ROI vs. Data Leakage risk.

## ⚡ Architecture

Using a Hexagonal Architecture to isolate Business Logic (French Law) from Infrastructure.

    GoogleAgent->>Firewall: Request Catalog Ingestion (Intent: BUY)
    Firewall->>AWS: Check Egress Rate
    AWS-->>Firewall: Rate = 0.09 EUR/GB
    Firewall->>Policy: Validate against NOR:ECOI2530768A
    Policy-->>Firewall: VIOLATION DETECTED
    Firewall-->>GoogleAgent: 403 FORBIDDEN (Legal Reason: Data Sovereignty)

## 🛡️ Anti-Bypass Mechanisms
- **Zero-Size Detection:** Prevents agents from obfuscating data volume via fragmented null-payloads.
- **Semantic Correction:** UCP 1.0 overhead is decoupled from actual data sovereignty valuation.
- **Async Profiling:** Built-in latency monitoring to ensure zero-bottleneck in high-frequency trading.
